read_eip:
   ; This is a rather clever way of reading the current instruction pointer.
   ; When read_eip is called, the current instruction location is pushed
   ; on the stack. Normally we use "ret" to return from a function.
   ; This instruction pops the value from the stack and jumps to it.
   ; Here however, we pop the value ourselves into EAX (EAX is the 
   ; 'return value' register for the __cdeck calling convention), then jump to it.
